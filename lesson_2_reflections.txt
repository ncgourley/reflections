What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a private dir with files used to maintain archive information and snapshots.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It's a place to keep track of what changes you want to move to version control.  It's useful for organizing revisions clearly.
